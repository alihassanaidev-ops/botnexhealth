# Outbound Engagement Engine — Follow-ups & Gaps Register

**Last updated:** 2026-07-04
**Purpose:** the **single source of remaining work** for Phase 2 — every open gap, deferral, bug, and
follow-up across all 12 plans, de-duplicated and prioritized. This is the "what's left / why" companion to
`verification-phase2-v2/report.md` (which is the "where we are / status" document). To avoid duplication:
**status + percentages live in the report; actionable remaining work lives here.**

**Legend:** ✅ done · ❌ dropped (product-owner decision) · ⬜ open.
**Priority:** **P0** = fix before any real/at-scale send (correctness/security/patient-safety/legal) ·
**P1** = needed for a complete, trustworthy launch · **P2** = hardening / scale / polish.

**Product-owner decision (2026-07-04): NO caps or limits on clinics/locations, and no tenant-based caps.**
Frequency caps, spend/budget caps, blast-radius/step-up gates, and per-location outbound concurrency caps
are **dropped, not deferred**. Non-cap vendor-throughput *smoothing* and per-clinic *isolation* remain valid.

---

## ✅ Done (this + prior sessions — for the record, not action)

- **P0-1** NexHealth webhook fails closed in prod (startup guard in `config.py` + 403 in `_verify_signature`).
- **P0-2** Email consent keyed on an **email identity** (`ConsentRecord.email_hash` + `hash_email`; gate split
  email vs phone; migration `20260705_consent_email_identity`) — email-only contacts no longer blocked `no_phone`.
- **P0-3** Voice **idempotency guard** — `VoiceNodeExecutor` skips re-dial if a completed `call_placed` step exists.
- **XC-1** Send-time idempotency for **all three channels** (`runtime.already_sent` checked first in the SMS/
  email/voice executors → skip + advance if already sent), **plus** a latent quiet-hours hold→resume
  unique-index collision fixed (`begin_step` now allocates the next `attempt_number`). Verified 1329 unit +
  7 integration. Residual crash-window tracked as **XC-1b** below. Session: `outbound-xc1-send-idempotency/`.
- **Plan 12 semantic layer:** content-class/PHI validator wired into publish + `/validate`; AI-voice disclosure
  injection; **bilingual FR STOP**; **do-not-contact scope tiers** + DNC now enforced on **all** channels (voice/email were a hole).
- **Plan 02:** builder wires `/validate` `/versions` `/merge-fields`; merge-field drift fixed; the validation panel
  surfaces the new compliance codes automatically (no FE change needed).
- **Engine hardening (finalize):** inline path unified onto gated `build_dispatcher` (kills Finding A); quiet-hours
  **hold-and-resume** (Finding B); real emergency-halt (terminates in-flight runs + cancels timers); stale-claim
  recovery wired; enrollment idempotency race fixed; template instantiate fixed; two fresh-deploy migration bugs +
  two Alembic heads fixed.
- **Plan 09 (finalize):** cancellation handling + `PmsLiveRevalidationService` at dispatch (Finding E, minus reschedule re-enroll); real recall pull.
- **Plan 07 (merged 2026-07-04, `97fe227`):** AI-callback core — `callback_requested` trigger, `CallbackTriggerService`,
  `trigger_callback_workflows` task, Retell webhook hook. Merged into `ali/phase-2` with zero conflicts; 1340 unit green. Residual: CB-2..CB-4.
- **Test-suite green (2026-07-04):** 1325 unit + 6 integration, 0 failures. Cleared: a **real auth bug**
  (`RefreshTokenService._encode_session` stacked decorator broke login on Python 3.13+; fixed — *auth subsystem,
  flag to auth owner*); re-enabled the PHI tenant-scope invariant (was silently disabled by a cp1252 read) + fixed a
  stale allowlist line; RBAC route-matrix drift (6 automation routes added); stale engine/event tests; `respx` dev dep added.

## ❌ Dropped (product-owner: no caps) — do not build
- Frequency caps (≤1/day, ≤3/week) — was Plan 12 / TCPA-exemption condition; risk accepted.
- Spend / budget caps; blast-radius / projected-spend step-up gate (Plan 12).
- Per-location outbound **concurrency cap** (Plan 03). *(Per-clinic Retell workspace isolation / BYO-SIP is NOT a cap — see Plan 03 P2 below.)*

---

## ⬜ Open work — by plan

### Cross-cutting (highest-leverage)
- **XC-1b (P1) Crash-window idempotency (residual of XC-1, which is ✅ done — see Done above).** XC-1's guard is
  same-transaction; a hard worker crash
  *between* the vendor send and the task commit rolls back the claim, so a retry could re-send (vendor may
  already have sent). Close with a **committed-before-send claim** (own session, like `record_usage_event`)
  and/or a **provider idempotency key** keyed `{run.id}:{node.id}` (Resend `Idempotency-Key` header; Twilio/
  Retell where supported).
- **XC-2 (P2) Channel integration tests.** SMS/email/voice are unit-tested with mocked vendors only; extend the
  real-Postgres engine integration pattern to a sandboxed Twilio/Resend/Retell path.
- **XC-3 (P2) Migration convention.** Every post-baseline migration must be idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`) — the
  baseline builds schema from live metadata. Broke fresh deploys twice (both fixed). Document it + audit remaining migrations.
- **XC-4 (P2) Ops rollout.** CloudWatch alarms for workflow/usage metrics (backlog, stale timers, failed runs);
  operator runbooks (pause/halt/dead-letter replay); feature-flag the scheduler for staged go-live.
- **XC-5 (P2) Non-cap paced dispatch.** Global smoothing against the shared NexHealth ~1000/min key + Twilio/Retell
  limits (not a per-clinic cap). Only jitter ships today. Coordinate with Plan 09 backfill.

### Plan 03 — Outbound Voice (~35%)
- **V-1 (P1) Outcome feedback loop — the central gap.** The Retell webhook never reads `metadata.workflow_run_id`
  (`RetellCallWebhook` uses `extra="ignore"`; correlates only by `agent_id`→location). Wire the webhook back to the
  run, record a **dial outcome**, and enable **branch-on-outcome** (busy/no-answer/voicemail/answered/booked),
  **retry-on-no-answer**, **voicemail→SMS fallback** (re-checking the SMS channel's own consent), and **book→exit**.
  Without this, outbound voice can't do the campaign behavior scope §7.2 requires.
- **V-2 (P1) Disclosure not proven spoken.** Executor injects `compliance_disclosure`, but the live Retell agent
  prompt only reads `first_name`/`user_number`. Update each location's Retell prompt to speak
  `{{compliance_disclosure}}` (onboarding step) — it's a TCPA/CASL AI-voice legal requirement.
- **V-3 (P1) Marketing consent-basis not hard-enforced.** The gate only checks a ConsentRecord exists/isn't revoked;
  Recall/Sales express/written consent is a publish-time **warning** only. Hard-block marketing-class voice without an express basis.
- **V-4 (P2) Dedicated data model.** No `outbound_voice_profiles`, `workflow_voice_attempts`, or `calls` linkage
  columns (reuses the generic step ledger). Needed for per-clinic setup + attempt/outcome history + UI.
- **V-5 (P1) Voice usage metering** — see M-1 (voice emits no `UsageEvent`; highest-cost channel).
- **V-6 (P2) Transient Retell errors fail the whole run** (executor catches + `fail_run`, no re-raise → no task
  retry/dead-letter). Re-raise for a bounded retry; distinguish vendor failure from patient outcome.
- **V-7 (P2) Extract `OutboundVoiceService` / `RetellOutboundClient`** — HTTP + payload + error handling are inline in the executor.
- **V-8 (P2) Voice UI** — outbound-profile CRUD, readiness status, campaign call-attempt drill-down (needs V-4).
- **V-9 (P2, non-cap) Per-clinic Retell workspace isolation (BYO-SIP)** — single platform `retell_api_secret` today
  (scope §3.5/§7.2). Isolation, not a numeric cap.

### Plan 04 — Outbound SMS (~70%)
- **S-1 ✅ (via XC-1)** SMS send-time idempotency — the shared `already_sent` guard now covers SMS (skip + advance
  if already sent). Residual crash-window = **XC-1b**. A dedicated `workflow_sms_attempts` table is optional polish.
- **S-2 (P1) Free-text inbound routing** — replies are ignored (empty TwiML, no persistence/notification). Build
  `inbound_sms_messages` + `InboundSmsRoutingService` (staff notification at minimum).
- **S-3 (P2) `sms_history_logs` workflow linkage** — add `workflow_run_id`/`step_id`/`campaign_id`/`attempt_number`/
  `provider_segments`/`price_*` so delivery joins to a run/attempt (linkage currently only on the separate `usage_events` row).

### Plan 05 — Outbound Email (~30–35%)
- **E-1 (P1) Unsubscribe** — link/token + email suppression. Legal minimum (CASL/CAN-SPAM); do not launch email without it.
- **E-2 (P1) Bounce/complaint/delivered webhook** — `EmailWebhookService` + signature verify + suppression from hard bounce/complaint.
- **E-3 (P2) HTML/branded body** (plain text only today) + email-specific merge-field allowlist.
- **E-4 (P2) Per-tenant sending domain** — SPF/DKIM/DMARC + warm-up + encrypted per-tenant Resend key + `EmailSendingProfileService` (see Plan 10).
- **E-5 (P2) Email attempt/audit log** (`workflow_email_attempts`) — no per-send record today → future bounce reconciliation impossible.
- **E-6 (P1) Email cost not captured** — metered at $0 (see M-3).

### Plan 06 — Four Live Campaigns (~50–55%)
- **C-1 (P1) Confirmation "confirmed"-branch is dead code** — nothing writes `appointment_status` into run state, so
  the confirm branch is unreachable (always exits `no_response`); mirrored in the reactivation `appointment_booked`
  branch. Fix requires the inbound-response→run linkage (ties to S-2 / V-1) and/or PMS write-back (C-2).
- **C-2 (P1) PMS confirmation write-back** — no `update_appointment` capability exists; Confirmation can't write status back to NexHealth.
- **C-3 (P1) Sales Qualification campaign** — absent (the 4th template slot is a non-plan `reactivation` campaign); needs new-contact/CSV enrollment.
- **C-4 (P2) DB-backed versioned templates** — templates are in-code dataclasses, not `workflow_templates`/`_versions`; edits can't be versioned/propagated safely.
- **C-5 (P2) Normalized outcome mapping** + channel-order/fallback/attempt-ceiling config.

### Plan 07 — AI Callback Handling (~60% — core v1 merged 2026-07-04, Hammad `97fe227`)
- **CB-1 ✅ (core merged)** — `callback_requested` trigger + `CallbackTriggerService` + `trigger_callback_workflows`
  task + Retell webhook hook (loop-guarded). Enrolls via `enroll_and_start_workflow_run` → inherits the gate,
  revalidation, and XC-1 idempotency. Opt-in = activating a `callback_requested` workflow.
- **CB-2 (P1) Confirm quiet-hours callback behavior.** Their design assumed `hold`=terminate→manual queue (old
  engine); on this branch `hold` **defers-and-resumes**, so a quiet-hours callback is placed at the next window.
  Confirm that's the intended product behavior (and update their session `findings.md` D2/D4 notes).
- **CB-3 (P1) Voice-consent path for callbacks.** A callback voice call needs a VOICE `ConsentRecord` or the gate
  blocks it (`no_voice_consent`) → stays in the manual queue. Confirm callback-eligible patients get voice consent captured.
- **CB-4 (P2) Packaged AI-callback template + optional `callback_workflow_links`/settings tables** (deferred by the
  leaner opt-in-via-activation design). Also inherits Plan 03's fire-and-forget voice limits (see V-1).

### Plan 08 — Campaign Management / Analytics UI (~22%)
- **U-1 (P1) Enrollment UI + CSV import** (mapping/validate/preview) + `campaign_enrollment_batches`. Backend
  single/bulk enroll exists but is unconsumed by the UI.
- **U-2 (P1) Emergency-halt UI** — backend routes exist, no frontend surface.
- **U-2b (P1) Privileged institution/DSO-wide DNC admin endpoint + UI** — the `set_do_not_contact` writer exists (Plan 12); expose it.
- **U-3 (P2) Analytics/reporting page + attributed revenue** — blocked on Plan 11 rollups (M-2).
- **U-4 (P2) Operations page** — dead-letter/replay, stale-timers, run-detail timeline.
- **U-5 (P2) SSE real-time** — pages are manual-refresh; wire `workflow_run_updated`. Fix native `confirm()` → app Dialog; add location scoping.

### Plan 09 — Integration & Data Layer (~40%)
- **D-1 (P1) Reschedule re-enroll at the new time** — a rescheduled appointment's reminder is **silently dropped**
  (time-independent idempotency key dedupes the re-enroll; revalidation then skips the stale-time send). Needs the time-aware working-set (D-3).
- **D-2 (P1) Revalidation freshness window** — dispatch revalidates *every* appointment run live → an 800-patient
  9 AM batch = ~800 burst NexHealth calls. Add a recent-webhook freshness window + shared-key budget.
- **D-3 (P2) Disposable read-model core** — `appointment_working_set` / `recall_eligibility_working_set` projections,
  `nexhealth_webhook_subscriptions` + lifecycle, a webhook **event ledger** (edge idempotency + audit), initial REST
  **backfill** (go-forward-only gap today), and a paced **reconciliation sweep**. Enables D-1 + out-of-order/staleness resilience.
- **D-4 (P2) Perf** — whole-table workflow scan per webhook; no event-level idempotency (dup deliveries re-run).

### Plan 10 — Per-Tenant Provisioning (~25%)
- **PR-1 (P1) Audit-log provisioning credential changes** — `admin_institutions.py` PATCH/DELETE of Twilio/email
  creds are NOT audited (violates the plan's audit requirement). Quick fix.
- **PR-2 (P2) First-class readiness *state* model** — readiness is computed on read; no persisted status/lifecycle.
- **PR-3 (P2) Provisioning automation** — Twilio sub-account creation, A2P 10DLC / toll-free registration, email
  domain SPF/DKIM/DMARC + warm-up (all manual today); Secrets Manager for tenant creds; per-location sub-account scoping.

### Plan 11 — Usage & Cost Reporting (~15%)
- **M-1 (P1) Voice usage metering** — voice emits no `UsageEvent`; wire it in the Retell **post-call webhook** (has duration/minutes).
- **M-2 (P1) `usage_cost_rollups`** (location→institution→DSO) + `UsageRollupService` + reporting API — **blocks Plan 08 analytics (U-3)**.
- **M-3 (P1) Capture email cost** (Resend cost currently unmetered → $0); handle late price-update webhooks (currently dropped by idempotency no-op).
- **M-4 (P1) Re-tag `usage_events`** — add `workflow_run_id`/`campaign_key`/`institution_group_id`; **without this,
  per-campaign spend is impossible even once rollups exist.**
- **M-5 (P2) `usage_budgets` + dashboards** (read side; note: budget *caps* are dropped, but budget *visibility* is not).

### Plan 12 — Compliance & Consent (~60%)
- **CO-1 (P2) Named `ConsentService`/`SuppressionService`** — logic currently lives in the gate + `SmsComplianceService`.
- **CO-2 (P2) US cross-timezone quiet hours** — clinic-TZ only; a US clinic calling out-of-region patients can breach their local quiet hours.
- *(Consent-basis hard-enforcement for marketing voice = V-3; DNC admin endpoint = U-2b.)*

## Suggested execution order
1. ✅ **P0 send-safety bundle** + **Plan 12 semantic layer** — DONE.
2. ✅ **XC-1 send-time idempotency (all channels)** — DONE (+ latent hold-resume collision fixed).
   Remaining: **XC-1b** crash-window (committed-before-send claim / provider idempotency key) before high volume.
3. **Plan 11 rollups + voice metering + re-tagging** (M-1..M-4) — unblocks Plan 08 analytics.
4. **Plan 09 resilient core** (D-1..D-4) — reschedule re-enroll, freshness window, projections/backfill/reconciliation.
5. **Plan 05 email hardening** (E-1/E-2) — unsubscribe + bounce/complaint; independent, legal minimum.
6. **Plan 06 differentiators** (C-1..C-3) — PMS write-back (fixes dead confirm-branch), Sales Qualification.
7. ✅ **Plan 07 AI callback** — core v1 merged (2026-07-04). Remaining: CB-2/CB-3 confirmations + CB-4 template/tables.
8. **Plan 03 outcome feedback loop** (V-1..V-3) + **Plan 10** (PR-1 quick audit fix, then PR-2/PR-3).
9. **Plan 08 full UI** (U-1..U-5) + **Ops** (XC-4) + remaining P2 polish alongside.
